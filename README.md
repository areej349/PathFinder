## PathFinder 
### In our final project in the bootcamp, we analyzed on the dataset for jobTeaser - a platform that collaborates with companies to provide job advertisements so that students or recent graduates can easily find job opportunities - 
So we measure recruitment performance at jobTeaser using the funnel algorithm.


### Drops:

- Drop 1: (25.5% Student not qualified)
:  Hyp1: Students were not shortlisted because they did not upload their CV and not active

- Drop 2: (82% Didn’t join to the shortlist)
:  Hyp1 : The size of the shortlist is insufficient to accommodate all qualified

- Drop 3: (76% of student not interested)
:  Hyp 1 : 50% of people are not interested because “auto-timeout”
AND Hyp2: Many of the not-interested joiners are old candidates

- Drop 4: (93.3% not approved)
:  Hyp1: JobTeaser is failing to interactive with all individuals interested in career opportunities.
